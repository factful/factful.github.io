Factful is building technology for journalists and civil society researchers. Newsrooms and investigative teams do vital work, exposing corruption and holding power accountable. We believe that powerful data analysis tools can be a potent force multiplier to that essential work. We’re developing software that makes powerful data analysis accessible to journalists and researchers.

We’re just getting started. We’d love to keep you in the loop.
