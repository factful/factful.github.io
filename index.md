Factful is building technology for journalists and researchers. Newsrooms and investigative teams do vital work, exposing corruption and holding power accountable. We believe that powerful data analysis tools can be a potent force multiplier to that essential work: so we’re developing software that makes powerful data analysis accessible to journalists and researchers. 

We’re just getting started. We’d love to keep you in the loop.
