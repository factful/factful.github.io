Factful builds tools that leverage the power of advanced computing to augment the vital work of reporters and investigators in their work to promote accountability and expose corruption.

We are building a robust, global data platform that will transform public-interest journalism. In an age of massive data leaks, widespread access to public data, and ever-larger social network streams, critical stories are fragmented across disparate data stores and formats, inaccessible to the technology found in most newsrooms.

##  Who We Are
**Veda Hlubinka-Cook** led a team at Applied Minds to develop collaborative data analysis tools for the US SIGINT analysts from 2002 to 2005. That work led her to co-found Metaweb, which developed Freebase, a massive entity-relationship database, acquired by Google in 2010 as the basis for the Knowledge Graph, which has become a key system powering Google’s infrastructure. 


**Ted Han** was the lead technologist behind DocumentCloud from 2011 to 2018, a successful project and hosting service used widely for publication of newsworthy documents and for document analysis. Ted has been involved in open source software for 15 years, was lead developer at Investigative Reporters and Editors and taught at Missouri University School of Journalism.  


**Jordan Mendelson** was the programmer behind Common Crawl, an open data nonprofit that archives a free copy of the web for researchers. Jordan previously founded SeatMe, a restaurant reservation system acquired by Yelp, as well as SNOCAP, a music licensing system. He was Chief Architect at Napster.

**Amanda Hickman** teaches data investigations at UC Berkeley’s School of Journalism. She led BuzzFeed’s Open Lab for Journalism, Technology, and the Arts from its founding in 2015 until the lab wrapped up in 2017 and has taught reporting, data analysis and audience engagement at graduate journalism programs at Columbia University and the City University of New York, and was DocumentCloud’s founding program director. Amanda has a long history of collaborating with both reporters and community organizers to design and create the tools they need to be more effective.
